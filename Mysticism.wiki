'''Mysticism''' is a practice in many religions and spiritual traditions where people attempt to seek union with what they perceive to be spiritual realities - the One, the absolute, God or the universe - through contemplative and ascetic practices including [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[fasting]], chanting of [[mantras]], [[koans]], [[aphorisms]], [[parables]] and other devotional sayings, [[retreat]], and occasionally use of psychoactive substances.

Those who practice mysticism often become more [[syncretism|syncretistic]], seeing religious denominations and philosophies as being different approaches to the unified Oneness of being. Religions which are centred on a holy text - [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] - often use those texts within mystical practice, meditating on passages and verses. Mystic practices often all point to a similar end goal of oneness - the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Nirvana]], union with Christ in Christianity, [[Irfan]] in [[Islam]] and so on.

== Scientific understanding of mysticism ==

In recent years, scientists have attempted to study the psychological, biological and sociological causes of religious belief and, by extension, mystical, transcendent and religious experiences. An example of this is Pahnke's [[Good Friday Experiment]] in 1962, where divinity students in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], were given [[psilocybin]] (with a control group being given [[niacin]] as a placebo) before going to a service at the [[Marsh Chapel]] at [[Boston University]]. Those in the live group claimed to have experienced religious experiences.<ref>Walter N. Pahnke, [http://psychedelic-library.org/pahnke.htm Drugs and Mysticism], ''The International Journal of Parapsychology'', 1966</ref> Others have repeated this experiment, and others, to better explore the link between mysticism and psychology, including [[Michael Persinger]]'s use of magnetic inducement of temporal lobe activity to prompt mystical or transcendent experiences in those who are prone to such experiences.
