'''Fascism''' is a political ideology of the far right that seeks national unity through patriotism, collectivism and opposition to [[liberalism]]. Fascism generally sees the individual as subservient to the group. The prototypical fascist state is usually seen as the [[Italy]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], and fascism is also thought of as an important undercurrent in [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Germany]] under [[National Socialism]].

Fascism as a movement tends to be a [[populism|populist]] movement, which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the party - in [[Germany]], this included the [[Hitler Youth]] and frequent marches. Fascism tends to play to a feeling of crisis and group victimhood (usually racial and nationalistic), blaming another group for social problems.

Fascism and fascist are also often used as a pejorative name for people. This was lucidly described by [[George Orwell]] in ''What is Fascism?'', where he described how it was used to describe a huge swathe of political ideologies and positions and is thus it has been rendered fairly meaningless.
