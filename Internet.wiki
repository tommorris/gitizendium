The '''internet''' is a network of [[computer networks]] used as transport mechanism for documents sent over the world wide web.  The research which resulted in the creation of the internet was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was established in 1958 as the first U.S. response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik<ref name="DARPA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/overtheyears.html|title=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|publisher=United States government|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>.  The first functional networks between individual computers were created in the early 1970's, and on a day in 1983, all computers on the so-called DARPA-net changed over at once to a new [[protocol]], TCP/IP, which is still in use on the internet today.  The fundamental transport [[protocol]] for the internet has not changed substantially in more than twenty years.  However, it is on the verge of changing in the near future.
