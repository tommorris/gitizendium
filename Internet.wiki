The '''internet''' is a network of [[computer networks]] used to transport documents over the [[world wide web]].  The research which led to the internet was funded initially by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was established in 1958 as the first U.S. response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik<ref name="DARPA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/overtheyears.html|title=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|publisher=United States government|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>.  The first functional networks between individual computers were created in the early 1970's.  Many educational institutions and corporations began joining the network, and on a day in 1983, all computers on the so-called DARPA-net changed over at once to a new [[protocol]], TCP/IP, which is still in use on the internet today.  The fundamental transport [[protocol]] for the internet has not changed substantially in more than twenty years.  However, it is on the verge of changing in the near future, with a movement from version 4 to version 6 of TCP/IP.
