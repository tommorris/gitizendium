A '''perpetual motion machine''' usually refers to a hypothetical machine that either keeps operating forever, or produces more energy than it consumes. It is considered impossible by the laws of [[physics]] as we know them.

== Usage in hoaxes ==
It is not uncommon for people to claim to have a perpetual motion machine which one could generate free energy from. These people are usually very secretive about their work and need sponsors while claiming that the secrecy is to protect them from dangerous entities that might be afraid of free energy (like big oil companies).

== Patent system ==
Since the patent system was put in place, it has received a number of patent requests for perpetual motion machines. The [[U.S. Patent Office]] now requires a working prototype in order to grant a patent for a perpetual motion machine.
