'''Feminism''' is a political, social, moral and intellectual movement that seeks the emancipation of women from discriminatory gender roles and laws. There are a wide variety of feminists, who define both the problem and the solution in different ways. Feminism as a political movement first attained a level of critical mass with the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the latter part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century.

After the success of the [[women's suffrage]] movement, a [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] movement came into being, which argued for a more radical change in society to change the cultural notions of womanhood. While the [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] movement attempted to address legal inequalities such as the right to vote and participate in civil society, the second-wave feminists were focused on fighting societal ''de facto'' inequalities, including discrimination in the workplace, [[rape]] and [[linguistic bias]] towards men. At this time, radical feminists also argued for [[female separatism]], and for [[political lesbianism]].

Feminism has a number of forms including [[liberal feminism]], which argues for social and political equality between men and women within Western liberal societies. [[Radical feminism]] sees capitalism as inherently sexist and patriarchal, and seeks a radical reworking of society so that it is no longer patriarchal. [[Sex-positive feminism]] is a movement within feminism that is reacting to some feminists who they see as [[sex-negative feminism|sex-negative]], that is to say disapproving of sexuality, specifically [[anti-pornography activism|anti-pornography activists]] including [[Catherine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]].
