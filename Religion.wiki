A <b>religion</b> can be defined as a system of [[belief]]s, values, principles, [[philosophy]], [[mythos]], and [[ritual]]s that deal with the ultimate concern of a person or society.  Common (but not universal) elements of religion include organized [[worship]] (possibly including a place of worship, commonly called a [[temple]], [[church]], or [[shrine]]), beliefs regarding the [[supernatural]], and respect for a high figure (who may or may not be [[divine]]).

== Organizing Religions ==

Organizing religions is a difficult task, as theologicians differ on where the differences.  For example, while "[[Christianity]]" describes a set of common beliefs in [[God]], [[Jesus]], and the [[afterlife]], there are vast differences in the various churches of Christianity.

As an example, the [[Baptist]] faith, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] all base their faith on the [[Bible]], but take different views on such things as organization, the necessity of proselytization, the rituals that have to be observed to be a devout Christian, the will of God, and the nature of [[evil]].

However, there are some common divisions that many scholars agree to:

[[Judeochristianity|Judeo-Christian]] religions believe in a heaven and hell.  They are based on [[Judaism]], and share many beliefs with that religion, although many rituals and concepts were borrowed in from [[Zoroastrianism]].  Although Christianity is traditionally defined as having been created at [[0 BCE]], Christianity itself did not spread and develop into its own culture until centuries later, Judaism pre-existed Christianity by centuries, and some branches of Judeo-Christianity split off from the main branches more than a milleium later.  Judeo-Christian religions include [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] (which is separated into hundreds of brances), [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Mormonism]], and [[Islam]] (which has several major branches).

[[Buddhism]] is ultimately derived from the life and teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama]] (c. [[600 BCE]]), although his teachings did not displace, but instead absorbed, the philosophies of the regions it spread to, providing for a continuence with other earlier faiths.  The three main branches of Buddhism are traditionally regarded as [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]], although some scholars speak of a "fourth Buddhism" coming into existance as the religion is studied in areas politically, geographically, and linguistically distinct from Buddhism's [[India]]n origins.  It also played an important role in [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]; however, these generally absorbed Buddhists philosophies, not the supernatural or ritual elements of Buddhism.

[[Hinduism]] is a groups of distinct but intimately related religions, made possible through the practice of [[henotheism]].  It is sometimes said that there as many forms of Hinduism as there are Hindus; however, the most-worshipped [[trinity]] of gods includes [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]].  It had a strong influence on other Indian religions, including [[Sikhism]].

[[Neopaganism]] (or "[[New Age]]") is a term coined to describe a modern trend of new religions which have a strong belief in the [[supernatural]].  These religions are very diverse, from [[doctrine|doctrinal]] to philosophical; some religions strongly reject the label as it has been used derisively by scholars of other faitsh, while some religions accept the label proudly.  Some of the best known Neopagan religions include [[Asatru]], [[Scientology]], and [[Wicca]].  [[Unitarian Universalism]] is sometimes considered a Neopagan religion, and sometimes a Judeochristian religion; it merits individual study.
