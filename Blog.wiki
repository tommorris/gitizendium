A '''blog''' is a journalistic [[website]] in which a "blogger" (web author, or site administrator) posts entries.  Often, entries are displayed in reverse-[[chronological order]].  

==Etymology==
"Blog" is a shortening of "we'''b log'''".  Blog can also be used as a verb to refer to adding an entry about a topic to a blog, as in "I blogged about that".  The originator of the word is disputed, but it originated in the late 1990s.

==Technical Preconditions==
Many bloggers use a [[hosted blogging service]], like [[Blogger]] or [[TypePad]] or [[LiveJournal]], which allow the blogger to get started without installing any software on their computer.  Some of these are ad-supported, and some offer paid ad-free models.

There are also dozens of blogging programs a user can install on his own computer, using a personal machine as his blog's [[server]].  These allow the blogger to decide whether or not to allow [[advertising]] for income but require the blogger to shoulder his hardware and bandwidth costs.

==Business Model==
Although most blogging is done for fun or for informational purposes, some blogging is done for monetary reasons.

Some businesses run blogs, where their [[Chief Executive Officer|CEOs]] or other ranking officials can write to the public, their customers, and to [[shareholder]]s.  Some of these blogs are actually written by the executive, but many are [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by staffers or assistants.  This model is also followed by political candidates.

Some bloggers accept money to do [[promotion]] for a company or its products without disclosing the arrangement.  For instance, a blogger working for a company or a [[PR]] firm might write a favorable review of a product, refute accusations against the company, or smear rivals in exchange for money.  Such actions are called [[astroturfing]], and are generally discouraged in the online community, as they represent an attempt to create "fake [[grassroots (politics)|grassroots]]", and astroturfers are denounced if and when discovered.

Finally, some bloggers with a large enough audience can make money off of [[pay-per-click advertising]] and selling merchandise.

==Accomplishments of Bloggers==

==Integrating Web 2.0 services==
Bloggers may make use of collaborative web tools in their blogs.  For instance, many bloggers store videos related to their posts on [[Youtube]] or [[Google Video]] and photos on [[Photobucket]] or [[Flickr]].  They link to other blogs, and find many of their stories on other collaborative websites like [[Digg]], which in turn finds and highlights interesting blog stories.
