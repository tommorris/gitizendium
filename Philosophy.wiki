'''Philosophy''', both the field and the concept, is notoriously hard to define.  The question "What is philosophy?" is itself, famously, a vexing philosophical question.  It is often observed that philosophers are unique in the extent to which they disagree about what their field even ''is''.

One approach is to give examples of philosophy.  [[G.E. Moore]] is said to have answered the question "what is philosophy?" by gesturing at his bookshelves and saying: "It is what these are all about."<ref>quoted by [[Antony Flew]] in his preface to the first edition of ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'' (1979)</ref>  Similarly, a good start at defining "philosophy" would be to explain that it is the main subject of the works of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Ren&eacute; Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[P.F. Strawson]].  Any such list, though, would be of necessity partial, and would raise further questions (in the case of most of those mentioned above, for example, some of their published works are not philosophical, so that the list is only really of use if one already understands what is and what is not philosophy).

Another approach is to list the main topics discussed by philosophers: any such list would include [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], and the [[philosophy of science]].  This has the advantage of emphasising the general and abstract nature of most of the subjects of philosophising, but again, any such list will raise further questions; any item in the list either explictitly relies upon understanding of the term "philosophy", or does so implicitly by raising the question as to what is a philosophical treatment as opposed to a non-philosophical treatment of, for example, ethics.

A third approach offers more promise.  Instead of a list of practitioners and their works, or of the topics that they discuss, we can describe the distinctive techniques of philosophy: what is it that Plato, Descartes, ''et al.'' do in their discussions of metaphysics, ethics, etc., which is distinctively philosophical?

Very roughly, we might say it is the study of, or wise reflection about, very general things.  To elaborate, we might say that philosophy is the study of the meaning and justification of beliefs about the most general, or universal, aspects of things &mdash; a study which is carried out not by experimentation or careful observation, but instead typically by formulating problems carefully, offering solutions to them, giving arguments for the solutions, and engaging in dialectic about all of the above.  Philosophy studies a huge range of general concepts, such as [[existence]], [[goodness]], [[knowledge]], and [[beauty]].  It asks questions such as "What is the good life?" and "Is knowledge even possible?"

One good way to understand the concept of philosophy is to examine its historical development.  The Greek word was ''philosophia'' (φιλοσοφία), meaning "love of wisdom".  ("Philo-" comes from the Greek word ''philein,'' meaning to love, and "-sophy" comes from the ''sophia'', or wisdom.)  The word ''philosophos'' (φιλόσοφος) was first used by [[Pythagoras]] to distinguish himself as a seeker of wisdom from those who thought of themselves as the wise (''sophos''; σοφός).  By the time of [[Socrates]] the word had come to mean something more like "scientific man" or "learned man".  Originally the scope of philosophy included ''all'' fields of study, other than history; as recently as the nineteenth century, what we now call "[[science]]" was called "[[natural philosophy]]" (this usage is still to be found in the names of departments, courses, and chairs in some Universities<ref>e.g., [http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/ the University of Cambridge] and [http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/wsearch/courses.html the University of Glasgow]</ref>).   In the last two centuries in particular, however, "philosophy" has come to mean an especially abstract, nonexperimental intellectual endeavour.

Popularly, the word "philosophy" is often used to mean any form of wisdom, or any person's perspective on life (as in "philosophy of life") or basic principles behind or method of achieving something (as in "my philosophy about driving on highways").  That is different from the academic meaning, and it is the academic meaning which is used here.


== A brief introduction to some leading problems of philosophy ==

== History of philosophy ==

Philosophy has a long history.  Generally, philosophers divide the history of Western philosophy into [[ancient philosophy]], [[medieval philosophy]], [[modern philosophy]], and [[contemporary philosophy]].  

Canonically, histories of western philosophy trace the origins of philosophical problems, ideas and practice to roots in ancient Greece {{citation needed}}.  Our sources for these roots are largely fragmented, and in most cases mediated throught the works of the later, better preserved Greek thinkers (see below).  These pre-socratic philosophers are grouped in a timeline running from [[Thales]] (fl. c.585 BC) through to [[Protagoras]](b. c.500 BC) and the thinkers of the [[The Sophists|Sophist schools]] .  This classification is possibly misleading - various schools and movements can be distinguished across this period, and some were contemporaneous with [[Socrates]] and his successors. 

[[Ancient philosophy]] was dominated by the trio of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].  In [[medieval philosophy]], topics in metaphysics and philosophy of religion held sway, and the most important names included [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Aquinas]].  [[Modern philosophy]], generally means philosophy from 1600 until about 1900, and which includes many distinguished [[Early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], such as [[Ren&eacute; Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].  [[Nineteenth-century philosophy]] is often treated as its own period, as it was dominated by post-Kantian German and idealist philosophers like [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[F. H. Bradley]]; two other important thinkers were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

In the [[twentieth-century philosophy|twentieth century]], philosophers in Europe and the United States took diverging paths.  The so-called [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] (or Anglo-American philosophers), including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], were centered on [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], and were joined by logical empiricists emigrating from Austria and Germany (e.g., [[Rudolph Carnap]]) and their students and others in the United States (e.g., [[W. V. Quine]]) and other English-speaking countries.

On the [[Continental philosophy|continent of Europe]] (especially Germany and France), the [[phenomenology|phenomenologist]] Germans [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] led the way, followed soon by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and other [[existentialism|existentialists]]; this led via other "[[isms]]" to [[postmodernism]], which dominates schools of [[Critical Theory]] as well as philosophy departments in France and Germany.

Please see our more exhaustive list of [[Philosopher|philosophers]] as well as the [[history of philosophy]] article, from which the above was taken.

== Philosophical subdisciplines ==

As with any field of academic study, philosophy has a number of subdisciplines.  Philosophy in fact seems to have a huge number of subdisciplines, in no small part due to the fact that there tends to be a "philosophy of" nearly everything else that is studied.  The beginner is invited particularly to pay attention to [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[ethics]], and [[political philosophy]] as--arguably, of course--the "central disciplines" of philosophy.

*[[Aesthetics]]: the study of basic philosophical questions about [[art]] and [[beauty]].
*[[Epistemology]]: the study of [[knowledge]], its nature, [[skepticism|possibility]], and [[epistemic justification|justification]].
*[[Ethics]]: the study of what makes actions right or wrong, and of how theories of [[right action]] can be applied to special moral problems.  Subdisciplines include [[meta-ethics]], [[value theory]], [[theory of conduct]], and [[applied ethics]].
*[[History of philosophy]]: the study of what dead philosophers have written, its interpretation, and who influenced whom.
*[[Logic]]: the study of the standards of correct [[argument|argumentation]].
*[[Meta-philosophy]]: the study of [[philosophical method]] and the goals of philosophy.
*[[Metaphysics]]: the study of the most basic [[category|categories]] of things, such as [[existence]], [[object]]s, [[property|properties]], [[causality]], and so forth.
*[[Philosophy of biology]]: the philosophical study of some basic concepts of biology, including the notion of a [[species]].
*[[Philosophy of education]]: the study of the purpose and most basic methods of education or learning.
*[[Philosophy of language]]: the study of the concepts of [[meaning]] and [[truth]].
*[[Philosophy of mind]]: the study of the nature of the [[mind]], and its relation to the [[body]] and the rest of the world.
*[[Philosophy of perception]]: the philosophical study of topics related to perception, especially the question what the "immediate objects" of perception are.
*[[Philosophy of physics]]: the philosophical study of some basic concepts of physics, including [[space]], [[time]], and [[force]].
*[[Philosophy of psychology]]: the study of some fundamental questions about the methods and concepts of psychology and psychiatry, such as the meaningfulness of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] concepts; this is sometimes treated as including philosophy of mind.
*[[Philosophy of religion]]: the study of the meaning of the concept of [[God]] and of the rationality of belief in the existence of God.
*[[Philosophy of science]]: includes not only, as subdisciplines, the "philosophies of" the special sciences (i.e., physics, biology, etc.), but also questions about induction, [[scientific method]], scientific progress, etc.
*[[Philosophy of social sciences]]: the philosophical study of some basic concepts, methods, and presuppositions of social sciences such as sociology and economics.
*[[Political philosophy]]: the philosophical study of questions about societies and social interaction, including the nature and justification of [[the state]], [[justice]], [[freedom]], [[law]], and [[punishment]].
''There are quite a few others; feel free to complete the list.''

== How to get started in philosophy ==

It is a platitude (at least among people who write introductions to philosophy) that everybody has a philosophy, though they might not all realize it or be able to defend it.  If you're already interested in studying philosophy, your reason might be to improve the way you live or think somehow, or you simply wish to get acquainted with one of the most ancient areas of human thought.  On the other hand, if you don't see what all the fuss is about, it might help to read [[the motivation to philosophize]], which explains what motivates many people to "do philosophy," and get an [[Philosophical method/Introduction|introduction to philosophical method]], which is important to understanding how philosophers think.  It might also help to acquaint yourself with some considerations about [[definition of philosophy|just what philosophy is]].

== Applied philosophy ==

Philosophy has applications.  The most obvious applications are those in [[ethics]]--[[applied ethics]] in particular--and in [[political philosophy]].  The political philosophies of [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[John Stuart Mill]] have shaped and been used to justify governments and their actions.  [[Philosophy of education]] deserves special mention, as well; [[progressive education]] as championed by [[John Dewey]] has had a profound impact on educational practices in the United States in the twentieth century.

Other important, but less immediate applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which might help one to regulate one's notions of what knowledge, evidence, and justified belief are.  [[Philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]], among other topics sometimes useful to scientists.  [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of art.  Even [[ontology]], surely the most abstract and least practical-seeming branch of philosophy, has had important consequences for [[logic]] and [[computer science]].  In general, the various "philosophies of," such as [[philosophy of law]], can provide workers in their respective fields with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.  

Moreover, recently, there has been developing a burgeoning profession devoted to applying philosophy to the problems of ordinary life: [[philosophical counseling]].
