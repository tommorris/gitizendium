'''Anti-intellectualism''' is the opposition to intellectualism, intellectuals and the views and methods of intellectuals. It is possible to be consciously anti-intellectual, but more often than not, anti-intellectualism is a label or sub-conscious position. Often fundamentalist religious movements or denominations are described as anti-intellectual, although they don't tend to be opposed to intellectuals, but rather are seen as discouraging critical or independent thought. Many modern conservative movements in the [[United States]] and elsewhere are often seen as anti-intellectual - blaming academics and intellectuals for moral decay by promoting unorthodox ideas and morals (the Princeton ethicist [[Peter Singer]] is often accused thusly), or accusing intellectuals of wasting time and resources on abstract and irrelevant thought when they should be spending their time on more useful pursuits. Typical of this attitude may be the former British education secretary, [[Charles Clarke]], who thought that education for its own sake was "a bit dodgy" because it lacked vocational utility - students "need a relationship with the workplace"<ref>BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2712833.stm Clarke criticised over classics]</ref>.

Although anti-intellectualism is often accompanied by anti-rationalism, those discussing the former usually distinguish it from the latter. Such was the case with [[Richard Hofstadter]] in ''Anti-Intellectualism in American Life'', who omitted from his classic text on the topic discussion of intellectual self-critique or anti-rationalist ideas from within the academy.

Being seen as "too intellectual" has been thought a political disadvantage in American politics for some time, and has been given as a reason for [[Al Gore|Al Gore's]] failure in the 2000 presidential election, [[John Kerry|Kerry's]] failure in 2004 and some commentators that the same may be true for [[Barack Obama]] in the forthcoming presidential elections<ref>Jonathan Chait, [http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/03/18/obama-s-speech-and-one-singular-advantage-of-being-black.aspx Obama's Speech, and One (Singular) Advantage of Being Black], blog on ''The New Republic''<br />Eric Boehlert, [http://mediamatters.org/columns/200706120005 The media's assault on reason], Media Matters for America.</ref>. Similarly, George W. Bush's populist appeal, in spite of his education at [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Harvard Business School|Harvard]], has been considered my some commentators an appeal to voter's "resentment of brains"<ref>Todd Gitlin, "[http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i15/15b00701.htm The Renaissance of Anti-Intellectualism]", ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' December 8, 2000</ref>. Before this, the presidential campaign by [[Adlai Stevenson]] and his 1952 defeat by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] is seen as a prime example of the political power of anti-intellectualism, and as the source of the term ''egghead'' (referring to Stevenson's bald head).

The perception of intellectuals that anti-intellectuals have is that they are out-of-touch with common morality, elitist, immoral, often unorthodox in their religious beliefs, and sometimes sexually unorthodox - [[homosexuality|gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[polygamy|polygamous]] or even [[asexuality|asexual]]. We can see a lot of this in the reaction to [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] proposed appointment at City College in [[New York City]], where religious activists blocked Russell's employment at City College because of his liberal morals regarding sex and marriage, his pacifist opposition to the first and second World Wars and his [[atheism]].<ref>See Professor Edwards' discussion in the appendix to Bertrand Russell's ''Why I Am Not A Christian''; Thom Weidlich's ''Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell'' and [http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa050300a.htm review of latter].</ref>

The causes of anti-intellectualism are varied but include a belief in some forms of [[pragmatism]], whereby the intellectual is seen as irrelevant, since truth can be determined more through ''doing'' than thinking abstractly. Others see intellectuals as the embodiment of elitism, or as being opposed to the interests of the common people. The combination of [[philistinism]], [[populism]] and belief in an elitist conspiracy are often used by politicians and media commentators in support of populist policies.
