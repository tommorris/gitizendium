'''Epistemology''' deals with questions like "What is knowledge?" and "How do we know this?".

== Etymology ==
"Epistemology" from "ἐπιστήμη" (knowledge) and "λόγος" (logos) was introduced into English by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier.

== Hellenistic views ==
The questions are as old as [[Philosophy]] itself, and the search for answers continues today.

[[Plato]] viewed knowledge as universal unchanging Ideas. One dialogue shows how all knowledge is inherent in everyone, whereas another says that that which must be there already to be able to percieve   the world around him.

[[Aristotle]] tried to divide the types of knowledge, that which can be said of knowledge, into ten Categories. He further attempts to classify knowledge in books named [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[poetry]] (including theater), [[biology]] and [[zoology]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[politics]], [[government]], and [[ethics]]. These areas of knowledge retain his names today.

== Scientific revolution: reason and experiment ==
Reason and observation are important to all knowledge, but are viewed differently from different vantage points.

=== Emiricims ===
[[Empiricists]], like [[John Locke]] later stresses the importance of observation and experiments to obtain knowledge, even to the point of assuming that a new born child has a [[tabula rasa]].

=== Ratonalism ===
[[Rationalists]] like [[René Descartes]] stress reason to arrive at knowledge since one can not always trust the senses.

== Modern ==
[[Immanuel Kant]] tries to resolve many issues, uses his twelve categories of knowledge and argues, as Plato did before, that there has to be something in man already there to let observation into the mind. That which is already there before is ''a priori'' and gives a rational basis for handling the empirical knowledge, which is ''a posteriori'' knowledge.
