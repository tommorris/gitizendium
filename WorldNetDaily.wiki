==Political relations==
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the [[Republican National Committee]] has paid WND for its mailing lists, and that critics have asked the RNC to cut ties with it, because "More than any other group, critics say, WorldNetDaily sets the conservative fringe agenda."<ref name=LAT2009-09-14>{{citation

In the ''Times'' article, it was reported that Joseph Farah had asked to hold a session on the [[birther]] issue (i.e., is Barack Obama a native-born American citizen?) at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], and told they did not have time for it given more important issues. "GOP strategist [[Jon Henke]] began a campaign against WorldNetDaily, which has published numerous articles giving credence to the birthplace issue and other allegations against the Obama administration. WorldNetDaily is also soliciting signatures and e-mail addresses for a petition calling on "any and all controlling legal authorities in this matter" to examine Obama's birth certificate."

WorldNetDaily is widely known for its advocacy of the theory that [[Barack Obama]] is not a natural-born citizen of the [[United States]] and is thus not eligible to be the President of the United States. WorldNetDaily published a purported Kenyan birth certificate with Obama's name on it, which turned out to be a clumsy fake produced by [[Orly Taitz]].<ref>David Weigel, [http://washingtonindependent.com/53494/birthers-latch-onto-forged-kenyan-birth-certificate ‘Birthers’ Latch Onto Forged Kenyan Birth Certificate], ''The Washington Independent''</ref>

==North American Union==
