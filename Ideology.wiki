An '''ideology''' is an organized set of ideas and ways of understanding the world, usually normative, and often on political, economic, ethical or philosophical subjects. Some ideologies are self-declared (e.g. [[environmentalism]] or [[libertarianism]]), while ideology is also used (often pejoratively) to refer to an unconscious set of ideas, practices and beliefs that are characteristic of a particular group but which are not held openly - for instance, many critics of [[capitalism]] think of it more as an unconscious delusion or a box which a person cannot think outside of. Marx, for instance, sees social ideology as being a ''superstructure'' that is heavily determined by the ''economic base'' of a particular society, rather than as something that is freely chosen.
