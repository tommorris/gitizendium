==Motivations==
He is listed as an extremist individual by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL). According to the ADL, the transforming events of his life came from reading the racist theory works of [[Francis Parker Yockey]]; [[Revilo Oliver]] introduced Carto's remembrance of Yockey.  In the early 1950s, he served as director of the Congress of Freedom, "which sought to build coalitions between racists and hard-right libertarians, and as executive secretary of Liberty and Property (which he founded).", and was editor of '' Right'', "an information clearinghouse for racist and anti-Semitic activities". <ref name=ADL> Also motivating him was a leftist historian, [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], who was, according to [[Murray Rothbard]], "the father and the catalyst for all of World War II revisionism," <ref>{{citation

==Liberty Lobby==
In 1956, he founded [[Liberty Lobby]], described by [[Mother Jones]] magazine as a secretive, "ultra-conservative pressure group... estimated to be a multimillion-dollar operation"<ref name="mjones">Zina Klapper, "The Force of Willis Carto", [[Mother Jones]] April 1981, p. 6</ref>. 

The group published a newspaper entitled ''The Spotlight'' (subtitled "The Voice of the American Majority"). ''The Spotlight'' often included material that was anti-Semitic and racist, and was part of Carto's broader media appeal. He briefly owned, for example, part of [[Resistance Records]], the leading distributor of white power hate music.  

The Liberty Lobby closed operations in 2001.
==Institute for Historical Review==
==Populist Party==
==Barnes Review==
He started the ''Barnes Review'' in 1994. At its 2002 conference, [[William Lind]] of the [[Free Congress Foundation]], who decidedly is not a Holocaust denier, blamed "political correctness" and other evils on so-called "cultural Marxists..."These guys were all Jewish."  The publication, in 2008, has, including in articles signed by Carto, emphasized [[Christian Identity]].<ref name=SPLC-Barnes>{{citation
